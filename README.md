##Importan##
The theme was broken with the last discord update (channels menu no longer transparent) I'll fix this as soon as I can, not at home atm.

##Downloads##
P.S. If you want you can replace the background image but it needs to be a https connection for it to work.
You can open the file with notepad and change the image link in the body tag.
